# xml-ddi-management
Several functions to create, manipulate XML DDI files in R environment.
In R, it is already possible to manipulate XML files but it is not so adapted for the curation, the harmonization of many files.
To use these functions, it will be necessary to declare the library <i>xml2</i> and to define a DDI XML Scheme (or any XML scheme).
<p>For more information about the DDI Scheme : <a href="https://ddialliance.org/">follow the link</p>
